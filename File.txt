-- The Agera S

The Agera S was the first Koenigsegg to
feature the revolutionary, in-house
developed and produced Koenigsegg
hollow carbon fiber Aircore wheels. It
came with an optimized-for-petrol-only
1030 hp twin-turbo engine and had an
incredible top speed of over 400 km/h.

-- The CCXR “Flower Power”

The CCXR was a CCX with “Flower Power” added, as it
could also run on renewable fuel such as E85 ethanol,
making it the world’s first green supercar.

-- The CCGT

The CCGT came about as side project for Christian and
the engineers at Koenigsegg. When Christian started to
build and design the first CC prototype, racing was
always part of the larger picture.

-- Agera 

Agera means “to take action” in Swedish, and is also an
abbreviation of Ageratos, ancient Greek for “ageless” –
both suitable descriptors for this incredible and beautiful
machine.

-- ENDING 

Making its debut at the Paris Auto Show in 2000 after 8
years of development, the CC8S was Koenigsegg's very
first production model. With its carbon chassis and body,
record-breaking engine power, and removeable and
stowable roof, the CC8S laid the foundation for the
aesthetics, philosophy and functionality of all
Koenigsegg cars since. Just 6 examples of the CC8S
were made, in 2002 and 2003.
